# Fun fact:‚ö°
I Have a [![TikTok](https://img.shields.io/badge/TikTok-%23000000.svg?logo=TikTok&logoColor=white)](https://tiktok.com/@plant.tour) that talks about plants, the [@plant.tour](https://tiktok.com/@plant.tour).</br>
As a serious hobby, I like to cultivate plants. Now I own almost 300 plants from 226 different species, most native. Sometime I take some off the native plants cuttings and plant them on park and nature, tryint to restore the vegetatio  around me.
